\section{Ground Temporal Programs}\label{sec:ground}

We present an implementation the \emph{meta-telingo} system that,
given a fixed finite trace length, is capable of calculating the
temporal stable models of any temporal logic program. This
implementation is carried out by translating the temporal logic
program to a logic program using meta-programming, a flexible and
powerful tool to modify the semantics of ASP programs
\cite{karoscwa21a} \cite{gepuscto08a} \cite{eifalepf03a} that is built
into \verb|gringo|. The resulting logic program is then solved by the
ASP solver clasp \cite{gekanesc07b}.

In this section, we assume that the input temporal theory is ground,
i.e. contains no free variables, and in the following sections, extend
the approach to the non-ground, first-order setting.
