\section{Solving Non-Ground Temporal Programs}

To capture the semantics of grounding temporal rules, we need to raise
our discussion from the propositional to the first order level. For HT
the corresponding first order logics are the logic of Quantified
Here-and-There, and Quantified Equilibrium Logic, both of which are
well studied in the literature \cite{peaval06a} \cite{peaval08a}. The
discussion of a first order variant of THT, however, is somewhat less
exhaustive. Descriptions of the semantics of the telingo temporal
answer set solver remain on the propositional level. A paper where the
first order case is considered is \cite{agcapevidi17a}, where the
authors define the logic of Quantified Temporal Here-and-There with
static domains for operators $\Next$, $\alwaysF$ and
$\eventuallyF$. They consider a syntactic fragment of first order
temporal formulas called \emph{splittable temporal formulas} over
infinite traces, define a safety condition for such programs, and
discuss a solver for such programs, STeLP. In this section, we will
extend the definitions to all the temporal operators discussed in
Section 2, and extend the discussion to temporal programs (as defined
in this thesis), over which define a more permissive, but similarly
powerful safety criterion. Finally, we provide a grounding procedure
that results in a more compact ground instantiation than a naive
grounding approach, which allows us to reify and solve the resulting
propositional temporal program using our meta-telingo.lp encoding
discussed in the previous section.
